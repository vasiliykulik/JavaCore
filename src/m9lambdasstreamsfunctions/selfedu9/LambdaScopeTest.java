/*
Accessing Local Variables of the Enclosing Scope

Like local and anonymous classes, lambda expressions can capture variables; they have the
 same access to local variables of the enclosing scope. However, unlike local and anonymous
  classes, lambda expressions do not have any shadowing issues (see Shadowing for more
   information). Lambda expressions are lexically scoped. This means that they do not
    inherit any names from a supertype or introduce a new level of scoping. Declarations
     in a lambda expression are interpreted just as they are
 in the enclosing environment. The following example, LambdaScopeTest, demonstrates this:
 */

import java.util.function.Consumer;

public class LambdaScopeTest {

    public int x = 0;

    class FirstLevel {

        public int x = 1;

        void methodInFirstLevel(int x) {

            // The following statement causes the compiler to generate
            // the error "local variables referenced from a lambda expression
            // must be final or effectively final" in statement A:
            //
            // x = 99;

            Consumer<Integer> myConsumer = (y) ->
            {
                System.out.println("x = " + x); // Statement A
                System.out.println("y = " + y);
                System.out.println("this.x = " + this.x);
                System.out.println("LambdaScopeTest.this.x = " +
                        LambdaScopeTest.this.x);
            };

            myConsumer.accept(x);

        }
    }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        LambdaScopeTest st = new LambdaScopeTest();
        FirstLevel fl = st.new FirstLevel();
        fl.methodInFirstLevel(23);
    }
}
